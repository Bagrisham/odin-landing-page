# odin-landing-page

This is a repo for my landing page project (a standard example for the Odin Project).

Here is a link to the live page: https://bagrisham.github.io/odin-landing-page/

Yes, it is fairly basic, but the idea was to follow a rubric: 

1. https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png
2. 

This project exists to show that I can:
    Serve everything on GitHub
    HTML editing
    CSS configuration
    Flexbox
    Understanding text types (h1,h3,p,etc)
    Etc.

Ultimately, this was a training exercise.
Thank you for reading this (if you actually care enough).
